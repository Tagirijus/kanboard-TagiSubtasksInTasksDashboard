# Tagi Subtasks In Tasks Dashboard

#### _Plugin for [Kanboard](https://github.com/fguillot/kanboard "Kanboard - Kanban Project Management Software")_

With this little plugin I wanted to have _subtasks_ shown in the _tasks dashboard overview_ as well. Also it hides subtasks from the list, if they are done.

**!!! ATTENTION !!!**
**!!! At this moment only the latter one _(hide done subtasks in list)_ does work. Listing the subtasks in the tasks view of the dashboard still is WIP here !!!!**
